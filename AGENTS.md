# AGENTS.md — AI assistant context for AquaForge

AquaForge is an underwater voxel sandbox in Rust + Bevy 0.18. Think
"Minecraft, but the whole world is a seafloor." This file is written for
AI coding assistants (Devin, Claude, Cursor, Copilot-Workspace, etc.) —
keep it current whenever the repo's layout, commands, or conventions
change.

The human-facing feature list and prioritised backlog lives at
[`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) — always read that before starting
a feature task.

## Stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Language | Rust (2024 edition) |
| Toolchain | **Rust 1.89** — pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (Bevy 0.18 MSRV) |
| Engine | Bevy 0.18.1 |
| Graphics | wgpu, PBR `StandardMaterial`, custom `ExtendedMaterial` for water |
| Windowing | winit |
| CI | GitHub Actions — `cargo check`, `cargo build`, `cargo test` on `ubuntu-latest` |
| Target | Native desktop (Linux / macOS / Windows). No WASM yet. |

## Commands

```bash
# First-time Linux system deps (Bevy needs these):
sudo apt install pkg-config libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
  libasound2-dev libudev-dev libx11-dev libxcursor-dev \
  libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

# Build & run (pinned Rust will be fetched by rustup on first invocation):
cargo run --release

# Verify exactly what CI runs:
cargo check
cargo build
cargo test

# Run a single module's tests:
cargo test inventory::tests

# NOTE: aquaforge is a *binary* crate, not a lib. `cargo test --lib` errors.
```

Clippy is **not** enforced in CI — `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
may report pre-existing findings (`too_many_arguments`, `type_complexity`,
etc.) on the chunk mesher and systems. Don't chase those as part of a
feature PR; if you want to address them, do it in a dedicated lint-only
PR so the diff stays reviewable.

## Architecture

- **Plugins are the seams.** `main.rs` installs three top-level plugins —
  `AtmospherePlugin`, `GamePlugin`, `ControlsPlugin` — and each of those
  composes smaller plugins. New features should be added as a plugin
  wired into the nearest aggregate, not poked directly into `main.rs`.
- **Chunks are authoritative voxel data.** A `Chunk` is a 16³ grid of
  `BlockType` stored as a linear `Vec<BlockType>`. `Chunk::build_mesh`
  emits one `Mesh` per chunk using a **greedy coplanar-face mesher**
  with per-vertex ambient occlusion baked into vertex colours.
- **`ChunkMap` is the only way to translate world coords.** Use
  `world_block_to_chunk(world_block) -> (chunk_pos, local)` and
  `ChunkMap::get(chunk_pos)` to find the `Entity` holding a chunk's
  components. Anything that edits voxels (`edit.rs`, future inventory /
  save-load / networking) goes through this.
- **Rendering is PBR + fog.** `AtmospherePlugin` configures the main
  `Camera3d` with HDR, natural `Bloom`, exponential `DistanceFog`,
  tonemapping, and cascaded shadows. The sea surface is a separate
  tessellated `Plane3d` driven by `WaterMaterialPlugin` (an
  `ExtendedMaterial<StandardMaterial, WaterMaterialExt>` with a custom
  vertex shader in `assets/shaders/water.wgsl`).
- **Input uses `CursorGrabMode::Locked`.** The fly-cam reads `WASD`,
  `Space`/`LShift`, `LCtrl` sprint, and yaw/pitch from the locked
  pointer. Left-click grabs; Esc releases. `edit.rs` hooks into the
  same grabbed state for break/place and digit-key slot selection.

## Conventions

- **No bespoke voxel crate.** Value-noise, fBm, and the chunk mesher are
  all in-tree (`utils/noise.rs`, `game/chunk.rs`). Don't pull in a
  dependency for what's already ~50 lines of hand-rolled math.
- **Imports at the top of every file.** Never `use` inside a function.
- **Comments describe intent, not the diff.** If a comment only makes
  sense to someone reading the PR — e.g. "fixed bug X", "previously
  this did Y" — delete it. Put that context in the PR description.
  Reserve comments for non-obvious invariants (coordinate conventions,
  GPU layout alignment, face-winding direction).
- **Keep PRs focused.** One feature per branch, even when several are
  queued up. Formatting-only churn goes in its own PR.
- **Cross-chunk face-culling is a known pre-existing limitation.**
  Edits at a chunk boundary may leave a neighbour's mesh stale until
  that neighbour is remeshed. Don't silently "fix" this as a side
  effect of another feature — it warrants its own PR.
- **Match the repo's existing `rustfmt` output** (default settings).
  Pre-commit hooks are not configured, so run `cargo fmt` before
  pushing.

## Branching & PRs

- Default branch: `master`.
- Work branches use the `devin/<timestamp>-<slug>` convention.
- Always base feature branches off `master`, not off an open PR branch.
- PRs auto-get a Devin session link appended to the description — don't
  add one manually. Preview / Devin Review comments appear inline; read
  them before marking the PR ready.
- CI must be green before merging: `cargo check`, `cargo build`,
  `cargo test` + GitGuardian + Devin Review.

## Testing notes

- **`cargo test` runs unit tests as part of the bin crate.** Example:
  `src/game/inventory.rs` has a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block
  exercising `peek_selected` / `take_selected` / `deposit`. Tests live
  alongside the code they cover.
- **GUI end-to-end testing on Linux VMs:** boot the release binary
  under lavapipe with
  ```bash
  DISPLAY=:0 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan \
    VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.x86_64.json \
    ./target/release/aquaforge
  ```
  then maximise with
  `wmctrl -r AquaForge -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz`.
- **X11 cursor-grab trap (important):** the game uses
  `CursorGrabMode::Locked`, which calls `XGrabPointer` on X11. That
  **drops** `XTestFakeButtonEvent` injections (i.e.
  `xdotool click 1 / 3` don't reach Bevy as mouse-button events once
  the cursor is grabbed — camera rotation still works because raw
  `DeviceEvent` motion deltas pass through). Keyboard injection via
  `xdotool key` **does** work. For click-triggered logic, prefer unit
  tests against the underlying resource API that mirror the call
  sequence in `src/game/edit.rs` — see the `Inventory` tests in PR #7
  for the pattern.
- **Raycast silent no-op:** `edit.rs` early-returns when
  `target.face_normal == IVec3::ZERO` (ray miss). If you're scripting
  a placement test, pitch the camera down first with
  `xdotool mousemove_relative -- 0 400` so the crosshair is on a real
  block face before right-clicking.

## When adding a feature

1. Read `docs/index.html` → "Recommended next features" to confirm
   priority and anchor module.
2. Branch off `master` as `devin/<timestamp>-<slug>`.
3. Add the feature as a new plugin (or extension of an existing one).
   Update the relevant `mod.rs` to wire it in.
4. Add unit tests for any pure logic (inventory, noise, math, mesher
   predicates). GUI-observable behaviour stays manual.
5. Update `docs/index.html`:
   - Add a `<li><span class="pill done">PR #N</span>…</li>` entry to
     the "Timeline" section.
   - If the feature shipped a backlog item from "Recommended next
     features", flip its heading to include
     `<span class="pill done">Shipped in #N</span>` and rewrite the
     body in past tense.
   - Bump the file-count / LOC in the hero meta if the order-of-magnitude
     changed.
6. Update `README.md` **Controls** if you changed user input.
7. Open a PR with the standard template (summary, review checklist,
   notes). CI green → ready for review.
